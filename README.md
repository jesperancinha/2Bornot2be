This project is about nothing and everything possible. This project is only about experimented Java based technologies. It will use a standar front end, Angular JS, but for the backend the idea is to try different technologies ranging from Oracle, to Hadoop, Puppet, Wildfly, Jetty, Maven, Spring and any IoT based in Java.
