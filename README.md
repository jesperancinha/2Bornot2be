# 2Bornot2be

---

This project is about nothing and everything possible.

This project is only about experimented Java based technologies.

It will use a standar front end, Angular JS, but for the backend the idea is to try different technologies ranging from Oracle, to Hadoop, Puppet, Wildfly, Jetty, Maven, Spring and any IoT based in Java.

## Contents:

1. **2b2bcommon** - Just a bundle of common libraries
2. **2b2bhadoop** - Tests for big data access
3. **2b2postgres** - Tests for postgres access
4. **2b2bvaadin-app** - Tests for archetype web-app for vaadin (temporarily removed)
5. **2b2bjava8** - Tests for the Java 8 API
6. **2b2bpostgres** - Tests for PostgreSQL
7. **2b2bdesignpatterns** - Tests Design Patterns in java 8
8. **2b2bwebapp** - Tests for Spring framework
9. **2b2bwebapp-jee** - Tests for J2EE framework
## Know how:

1. This project uses Lombok libraries. These provide extra annotations which can only be read through a plugin installation.

> Read further in the lombok project page to find out more:

> * https://projectlombok.org/
> * https://projectlombok.org/download.html

2. To run the unit tests, the application context runs with a database access. This is a temporary situation.

> You need to grate an empty postgres database with a postgres user with a postgres password.
